The {{ .Release.Name }} cluster and associated extras have been installed.

You can access your services (GoCD, MLFlow, Kibana, Grafana) as follows:

  * From outside the cluster, run these commands:
    
    kubectl get svc

    Copy and paste the corresponding EXTERNAL-IP and PORT (the port on the left is the exposed port) 
    in your browser.

    NOTE:    It may take a few minutes for the pods and services to be available.
             You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get svc'
           
    WARNING: By default, most services (e.g. GoCD, MLFlow and elasticsearch) are exposed directly to 
             the internet.
             As a minimum level of security; switch to ClusterIP/NodePort and place an Nginx gateway 
             infront of the cluster in order to lock down access to dangerous HTTP endpoints and verbs.

  * Accessing pods on localhost:

    See all pods and services, run:

    kubectl get pods,svc
    kubectl port-forward --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} POD_NAME PORT:PORT
    
    Replace POD_NAME and PORT with the pod name and port of the service that you want to access.
    Visit http://localhost:PORT on your browser.
